### Keynote: "Recommender system evaluation: One gold standard, but no silver bullets"
Zeno Gantner, Zalando

**Abstract**     
In the field of recommender systems, we have a large and diverse set of evaluation methods at our disposal for both academic research and industrial applications.
Randomized controlled trials in the form of online A/B tests are widely accepted for data-driven decision making, but because of their cost in terms of time and effort they cannot support every single decision. We need different methods for different scenarios.
I will present a case study on controlling the effects of different levels of exploration between control and treatment group in an online A/B test.
Besides that, I will also talk about so-called diff-testing, which is a set of methods that allow estimating the impact of a change without relying on annotations or user feedback. Diff-testing is not covered much in the literature, but can be a valuable addition to a practitioner's toolkit of evaluation methods.
